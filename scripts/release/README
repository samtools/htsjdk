This document describes how to make an htsjdk release.

Setup your environment
1. Copy (or incorporate) the settings.xml file to ~/.m2/settings.xml
2. Request the htsjdk packager private GPG key
3. Edit the username, password, etc in ~/.m2/settings.xml

Once your environment is setup, you'll be able to do a release.

From the project root directory, run `./scripts/release/release.sh`.
If you have any problems, run `./scripts/release/rollback.sh`.

Once you've successfully published the release, you will need to
"close" and "release" it following the instructions at
