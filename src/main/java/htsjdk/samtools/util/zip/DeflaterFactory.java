/**
 * Create zlib-based Deflater if JNI library and other require libraries are available, otherwise create standard
 * JDK Deflater.
 * Java 7 has its own Deflater implementation (libzip.so).  This is almost as fast as a zlib-based Deflater, so in general
 * there isn't a compelling reason to use zlib.  However, Intel has created a hardware-assisted zlib implementation
 * as part of their IPP (Integrated Performance Primitives) package that can run significantly faster on some Intel
 * hardware.  We have seen compression times reduced by 13% to 33% depending on particular hardware, and hope that
 * newer Intel processors will be even better.
 *
 * Note that this class will no longer be necessary once Java 8 is required, because JDK 8 will use zlib instead
 * of libzip implementation.
