The initial set of test data formed part of Staden io_lib (BSD):

They then appeared in htscodecs (BSD mostly):

GA4GH advocates Apache 2.0 for software and its own license for

are designed for processing by software, so we also release them under

Note a larger set of test files may also be found at

The larger set is not formally part of the GA4GH test suite, but may
be of use during validation.
