- test/vcf/*.vcf:

    The vast bulk of the test files originated from European
    Bioinformatics Institute's vcf-validator:
    https://github.com/EBIvariation/vcf-validator/blob/master/LICENSE

    These are Copyright EBI and the project is Apache 2.0 licensed.

- test/vcf/4.*/passed/complexfile_passed_000.vcf:

    Also present in the EBI vcf-validator, however this data looks to
    be a subset of the 1000 Genomes project so it may be covered by
    the 1000 genomes license instead (i.e. freely available under the
    Fort Lauderdale Agreement).
    See https://www.internationalgenome.org/IGSR_disclaimer
    and https://www.internationalgenome.org/category/data-access/

- examples/vcf/simple.vcf:

    Copied from the VCF TeX document.  The example also appears in VCFtools
    (https://sourceforge.net/p/vcftools/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/) which
    is LGPLv3, but it is unknown if it was copied to there from the
    original spec or vice versa.
